libchebfun
==========

Unmaintained C implementation of some Chebfun basics.

This repo contains some C files which Pedro Gonnet and Nick Hale began working on in 2010. 

I can no longer get the code to compile, but it does still contain a number of C implementations of methods similar to those used in Chebfun V4 and Chebfuin V5. 

It might be useful to anyone hoping to implement a C or C++ version of core Chebfun functionality.
