Things that need to be done, in no particular order:


Things to do with usabiliy:

* 2011/01/18: Add chebfun object as a wrapper for funs.
* 2011/01/18: Add operators at some point.


Things to do with functionality:

* 2011/01/19: Make specific bary and clenshaw routines for real vs. cplx
              fun values and coefficients, let fun_eval do the
              dispatching.


Things to do with performance:

* 2011/01/23: In util_chebpoly and util_chebpolyval, fftw_plan_r2r_1d takes
              more time than the actual ffts. Some better way of re-using
              wisdom or the plans themselves?
* 2011/01/23: Use fmax/fmin wherever possible.


Things to do with testing:

* 2011/01/18: Not all routines in from src/fun.c are tested in 
              examples/chebtest.c yet.
