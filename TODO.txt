Things that need to be done, in no particular order:


Things to do with usabiliy:

* 2011/01/18: Add chebfun object as a wrapper for funs.
* 2011/01/18: Add operators at some point.


Things to do with functionality:

* 2011/01/19: Make specific bary and clenshaw routines for real vs. cplx
              fun values and coefficients, let fun_eval do the
              dispatching.
* 2011/01/21: fun_create_vec does not check if N gets too big.


Things to do with performance:

* 2011/01/18: Use SSE/SSE2 instructions in fun_eval_bary_vec to do
              up to four points at a time, perhaps move to util.c to
              keep things well separated.
* 2011/01/20: In util_bary_vec_real, look for hits using not bisection
              but round( arccos(x[j]) / PI * (N-1) ).


Things to do with testing:

* 2011/01/18: Not all routines in from src/fun.c are tested in 
              examples/chebtest.c yet.
