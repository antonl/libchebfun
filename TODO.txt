Things that need to be done, in no particular order:


Things to do with useabiliy:

* 2011/01/18: Add chebfun object as a wrapper for funs.
* 2011/01/18: Add operators at some point.


Things to do with performance:

* 2011/01/18: Use SSE/SSE2 instructions in fun_eval_bary_vec to do
              up to four points at a time, perhaps move to util.c to
              keep things well separated.


Things to do with testing:

* 2011/01/18: Not all routines in from src/fun.c are tested in 
              examples/chebtest.c yet.
